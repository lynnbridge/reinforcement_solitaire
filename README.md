# reinforcement_solitaire

## Created by Bridget

This repository is an exploration of creating a reinforcement agent to solve solitaire.

Code started based on Python Solitaire Simulator from Surya Dutta

To see their code [https://github.com/suryadutta/solitaire.git](https://github.com/suryadutta/solitaire.git)

This code was then modified to track scores, manage flipping the draw deck etc.

Since this is a reinforcement agent, the agent must determine the best policy or algorithm based on the constraints given.

Agent policy options are MAXSARSA, Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo tree search, Random, whatever else I decide to implement.
